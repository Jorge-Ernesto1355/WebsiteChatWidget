## 🧠 Data Format

Define a list of questions and answers the chatbot can use, with an optional `useCase` to control tone or behavior.

```ts
{
  useCase: "qa-bot", // or "customer-support", "documentation", "strict-compliance"
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Your question here?",
      answer: "The chatbot response.",
      category: "general",
      confidence: 0.85 // Value between 0 and 1
    },
    // Add as many as needed
  ]
}
```

### Supported `useCase` values

- `"customer-support"`: Friendly, helpful support tone
- `"documentation"`: Technical, concise answers
- `"qa-bot"`: Default Q&A with open logic
- `"strict-compliance"`: Controlled, policy-aware responses

## 🔐 Token Security

Your API tokens are never exposed to the client.

- ✅ Hugging Face or Replicate tokens are sent securely through a proxy
- ✅ No direct client-to-model communication
- ✅ Fully encrypted and safe

### 🔧 Advanced Model Configuration

Take full control of your AI's behavior with comprehensive model customization options:

#### 🎛️ **Core Parameters**

- **`temperature`** _(0.0 - 2.0)_ - Controls response creativity and randomness
- `0.1` = Focused, deterministic responses
- `0.7` = Balanced creativity (recommended)
- `1.5` = Highly creative, varied outputs

- **`max_tokens`** _(1 - 4096)_ - Maximum response length
- `50` = Short, concise answers
- `150` = Standard responses
- `500+` = Detailed, comprehensive replies

#### 🎯 **Fine-Tuning Options**

- **`top_p`** _(0.0 - 1.0)_ - Nucleus sampling for response diversity
- **`frequency_penalty`** _(-2.0 - 2.0)_ - Reduces repetitive content
- **`presence_penalty`** _(-2.0 - 2.0)_ - Encourages topic exploration
- **`stop_sequences`** - Custom stop words to control response endings
- **`model`** - Choose specific AI models for different capabilities

#### 💡 **Example Configuration**

```tsx
config={{
 temperature: 0.7,
 max_tokens: 200,
 top_p: 0.9,
 frequency_penalty: 0.5,
 model: "microsoft/DialoGPT-large",
 stop_sequences: ["\n\n", "Human:", "Bot:"]
}}
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- Do **not** use both `huggingface` and `replicate` props at the same time.
- You must import the CSS file for the widget to render correctly.
- The `chatStyles` and `headerStyles` props override any class-based styles (`chatClassName`, `headerClassName`).

  ⚠️ Important Note for Hugging Face Users
  If you're using this chatbot with Hugging Face and plan to enable <thinking> mode (or similar streaming indicators), make sure to set max_tokens to at least 500 in your configuration.

  is necessary because <thinking> consumes a significant number of tokens during generation. If max_tokens is too low, the assistant's response might get cut off or fail to generate properly.

---

## 🧪 Testing

- Includes support for unit and UI testing using **Vitest** and **Cypress**.
- Example test commands:

```bash
npm run test        # Vitest
npm run dev         # Local dev mode
npm run lint        # ESLint
npm run build       # Production build
```
